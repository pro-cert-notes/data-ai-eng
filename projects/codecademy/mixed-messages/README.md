# Portfolio Project: Mixed Messages
Mixed Messages is the porfolio project for the *Software Engineering Foundations* module of Codecademy's Back-End Engineer Professional Certification.

## Instructions
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

Project Objectives:
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

Prerequisites:
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line
